## Lambda Interpreter
Welcome to our repository containing a lambda syntax interpreter! This interpreter is designed to parse and evaluate expressions written in the lambda calculus, a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application.

Lambda calculus is a powerful tool for reasoning about computation and has been widely used in the development of programming languages and computer science theory. With our interpreter, you can experiment with lambda expressions and explore the power of this fascinating system.

Our interpreter is easy to use and comes with detailed documentation to help you get started. We’ve also included a number of examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the interpreter and to provide inspiration for your own experiments.

We hope that you’ll find our lambda interpreter to be a valuable tool for exploring the world of computation. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. We’re always looking for ways to improve our project and welcome contributions from the community.

Thank you for your interest in our lambda interpreter, and happy computing!
